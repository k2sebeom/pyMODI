#. git-flow
#. python unit-test
#. git commit message naming convention
#. docstring
#. python type annotations

Getting Ready for PyMODI Contribution
-------------------------------------

Please read the following to get ready for the contribution!!


#. 
   Fork the pymodi repo on GitHub

    
   .. image:: docs/_static/img/fork_button.jpg
      :target: https://github.com/LUXROBO/pymodi/fork
      :alt: Fork PyMODI


     ^ Click this to fork the repo!!

#. 
   In your device, clone your fork locally:

   .. code-block::

       $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/LUXROBO/pymodi.git

#. 
   Install the version of PyMODI in your branch:

   .. code-block::

       $ python setup.py develop

#. 
   Setup the git hooks to facilitate contribution:

   .. code-block::

       $ git config core.hooksPath .githooks

#. 
   Do NOT manipulate master branch or develop branch directly. Create a new branch for local development.

    PyMODI's branch naming convention follows a git-flow convention,

    If you fixed a bug:

   .. code-block::

       $ git checkout -b hotfix/name-of-your-bug-fix


    If you implemented a new feature:

   .. code-block::

       $ git checkout -b feature/name-of-your-feature

#. 
   Whenever you make major changes, make a commit to the repository:

   .. code-block::

       $ git add file-you-have-changed
       $ git commit -m your-commit-message


    PyMODI contribution follows a git naming convention for the commit messages.
    https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

    TL;DR: When writing a commit message, imagine your message is preceded by

    "This commit will... your-commit-mesage"

    e.g.

   .. code-block::

       $ git commit -m "Fix error in motor module communication"
       $ git commit -m "Refactor contribution document"
       $ git commit -m "Remove redundant import in modi.py"

#. 
   After you push your changes to local branch, make sure your code passes
   all unittests and flake8 convention tests. If you have set your githooks path at step 4,
   git will automatically run the tests when you push your changes.

#. 
   Make a pull request to LUXROBO/pymodi/develop branch.

    
   .. image:: docs/_static/img/pr_guide.png
      :target: docs/_static/img/pr_guide.png
      :alt: PR guide


   Name the pull request based on the default PR templates. Choose either of the templates based on the type of your contribution.

#. 
   Congratulations! You made a meaningful contribution to PyMODI.
